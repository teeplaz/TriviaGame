Trivia Game about vocabulary

Created with CSS, HTML, Javascript, JQuery and some good vibes.

What the project does: Users can player a 20 question trivia game. Each question has 4 multiple choices to pick from with. The user must select the one they either know or guess to be true. The user must answer each question before the 30 second timer runs out, but the timer will be reset for each question.

Why the project is useful: The site is useful as it offers a fun and easy game to focus on vocabulary words that are not frequently used.

How users can get started with the project: Users can begin by selecting the "restart" button.

Where users can get help with your project: User can get help with my project by contacting me on LinkedIn, through my github account, or my basic portfolio (https://drunnals313.github.io/Basic-Portfolio/contact.html)

Who maintains and contributes to the project: Only one contributor so far but if others were to pass along suggested code and enhancements we could continue to release better interations together.
