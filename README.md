Trivia Game about vocabulary

Created with CSS, HTML, Javascript, JQuery and some good vibes.

What the project does: Users can player a 20 question trivia game. Each question has 4 multiple choices to pick from with. The user must select the one they either know or guess to be true. The user must answer each question before the 30 second timer runs out, but the timer will be reset for each question.
